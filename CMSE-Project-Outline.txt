CMSE 202 Project Overview

GOALS:
* Create a model of solar systems that map out the habitable 
zone and the planets
* Maybe include the actual orbit of the planets, taking into 
account their eccentricity
* Create classes that are used to store the data
 

OUTLINE:
* Planet Class
	- Atributes:
		* closest distance to sun? 
			- could just use semi-major axis
		* eccentricity
		* orbital period
		* semi-major axis
		* planet name
	- Methods:
		* set/get distance? 
		* set/get eccentricity
		* set/get orbital period
		* set/get semi-major axis

* Sun Class
	- Atributes:
		* solar radius
		* effective temperature
		* solar type
		* sun name
	- Methods:
		* set/get solarradius
		* set/get solar type
		* get habitable zone
			- this would calculate the temperature gradient 
			and find the distances from the sun that are 
			0 and 100 celsius, as well as the distances that are 
			-10 and 110 celsuis (buffer zone in case of atmosphere)
				* research to find a more accurate buffer

* Solar System Class
	- use dictionaries to organize the planets (similar to the animal class)
	- Atributes:
		* sun name
		* planet names
		* number planets
		* solar system name
	- Methods:
		* add sun
			- would check to see if there is already a sun in the 
			system, would only allow one sun
		* add planet
		* get number planets
		* set/get solar system name
		* plot system
			- this should plot the solar system (similar to the plot
			in the day 11 PCA)
			- plots the habitable zone and the buffer
			- plots the planets
			- plots the sun at the center using it's type to determine 
			the color
		* get planets
			- lists out the planets and whether or not they are habitable
			- uses the planets distances and the sun habitable zones to 
			determine if the planets are not habitable, habitable, or 
			possibly habitable
		* plot orbits
			- plots the planets orbits using their distance/semimajor 
			axis as a starting point
			- uses their ecentricity in the calculation
